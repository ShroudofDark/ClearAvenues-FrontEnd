## Clear Avenues Project

Team Website: https://www.cs.odu.edu/~cpi/old/411/greens23/index.html

Backend: https://github.com/ShroudofDark/ClearAvenues-BackEnd


This is a bare cloned repo of the project done with the following members below. 

Clear Avenues is a smart device application that seeks to improve roads and safety by providing mechanisms to report unsafe road conditions to users and road maintainers. The software found in this repository was part of a prototype development that saw fruition at the end of a year long process done at Old Dominion University. It provided the ability to submit reports, review those reports, view a hotspot map with reports we collected alongside data from public accident databases. 

The application will no longer run as the database that stored our information no longer runs and the google maps API key has been revoked. A video of the prototype in action will be provided via the final presentation of our class.
